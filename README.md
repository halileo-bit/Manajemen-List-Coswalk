# Coswalk List Management System
<table>
<tr>
<td>
  This application is intended to make it easier for Coswalk (Cosplay Walking) competition registrants to register OTS without having to write by hand, while the admin feature is intended to create a list of registrants who register online as well as update data for registrants who register online but the costumes they wear are very different.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Program

### Login Page
It's currently under development because there's no participant data update feature yet. Therefore, the admin feature includes deleting participant data. However, a data update feature may be added in the near future to make it easier for admins to verify data when they attend cosplay events.
